# jscalendar
This is a small Javascript based Calendar. You can configure the following options:
- months: the name of the months (e.g. in German March is called MÃ¤rz)
- firstDayOfWeekOffset: the number of days for your start of the week. (JS default: Sunday, if you want Monday as your first day of the week, set this value to `6`)
- stylesheet: the path for the stylesheet.
- dayclickfunction: the function that is activated if you click on a date.

An example on how to embedd this calendar, see [example.html](./example.html)
