# jscalendar
This is a small Javascript based Calendar. You can configure the following options:
- rootElement: if you want to change the root element, in wich the calendar is generated. (The default element is `#calendar`)
- months: the name of the months (e.g. in German March is called MÃ¤rz). (Default is english)
- firstDayOfWeekOffset: the number of days for your start of the week. (JS default: Sunday, if you want Monday as your first day of the week, set this value to `6`)
- stylesheet: the path for the stylesheet. (The default is `./calendar.css`)
- onBoxReady: if a function is given here it will be called after each day is created. The function used here has one parameter, as wich the day-div element will be given. 
- days: here you can enter your local names for the days of the week (e.g. in German Monday is called "Montag", by default the names are in english)
- showWeekdays: when set to true the the names of the weekdays, which are set in the `days` option, will be displayed.

You can also change some of the styles used in the calendar via CSS-variables. Currently there are the following variables:
```css
	--calendar-bg:transparent;     /*background of the calender*/
	--calendar-day-bg:#eee;        /*background-color of the indiviual day elements*/
	--calendar-day-bg-hover: #222; /*hover background-color of the indiviual day elements*/
	--calendar-day-col: #222;      /*font-color of the individual day elements*/
	--calendar-day-col-hover: #eee;/*font-color of the individual day elements*/
	--calendar-month-size:20px;    /*font-size of the month "header"*/
	--calendar-day-size:16px;      /*font-size of the of the number of day*/
	--calendar-weekday-size:12px;  /*font-size for the day of the week element*/
	--calender-margin-sides: 10px; /*margins on the sides of the calendar*/
```
